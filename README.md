### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
>> The main challenge so far is to get cocoapods setup correctly on Mac Catalina 10.15.7. I had Loaderror issues when setting up the pod by `pod setup`. The final solution that helped after seeing "cannot locate gemfile" is to do `bundle init` and `bundle install`. Afterwards, `sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin cocoapods` and `pod setup` do the job.
